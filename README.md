# Projects-in-Js


Hello Everyone!
I have dedicated myself to learn more javaScript, then  I created four projects!


In the first project I created the Change Background Color. The users click on the button and change the color. I used the JavaScript Array and a put some color there.

In the second project I created the Hex Color Code. The look like the the first, while the first one changed the color it appears the hex color.

The third you can see  pass the message it is possible to add message. And fourth project you can see famouos quotes...
